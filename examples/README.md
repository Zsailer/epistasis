# Epistasis Package Tutorials

Some tutorials for this package are included in Jupyter (formerly IPython) Notebooks. Jupyter Notebooks and the IPython kernel are dependencies for viewing these notebooks interactively. If you'd like to just view a static representation of these notebooks, use NBViewer (once this repository is public).
