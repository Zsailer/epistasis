Proposed approach to quantifying epistasis
==========================================

In this `paper`_, we showed that epistasis arise both from specific interactions
between mutations (known as genotypic epistasis) and nonlinearity in the phenotype.
The ``epistasis`` package can be used to separate these two types of epistasis
from experimental genotype-phenotype maps.
