   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Epistasis Python API
====================

A Python API for modeling statistical, high-order epistasis in large genotype-phenotype maps.

**NOTE** : Currently, this package exists entirely as an API. There is not a command-line
interface for the package, and few ways to read/write the data. We plan to improve
this moving forward.
