# High Order Epistasis Models/Regressions for Genotype-Phenotype Maps

This package contains easy and *quick* tools that calculate the epistasis in a genotype-phenotype map. 

To install:

```python setup.py install```

or, if you'd like to soft install for development:

```python setup.py develop```

This package is still really hacked together. I plan to include examples and clean up some of the plotting/network managing very soon. 

Should work in Python 2.6+ and Python 3+

**NOTE:** This repository is still private. It will be public as soon as it's ready for publication.
