# High Order Epistasis Models/Regressions for Genotype-Phenotype Maps

This package contains easy and *quick* tools that calculate the epistasis in a genotype-phenotype map. 

To install:

```python setup.py install```

or, if you'd like to soft install:

```python setup.py develop```

This package is still really hacked together. I plan to include examples and clean up some of the plotting/network managing very soon. 

Works in Python 2.6+, haven't tried it in Python 3 yet.
